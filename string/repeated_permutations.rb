# find all ways of constructing sequences of length n drawing from a stock of  k distinct elements.

# special case: k = n (that's "ordinary" permutations). (right?)
# the difference here is that we can reuse symbols.
# we are not working until we have exhausted our stock (it's inexhaustible!), but until we have constructed a sequence of the required length
