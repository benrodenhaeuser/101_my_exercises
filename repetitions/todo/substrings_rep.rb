# Write a method that returns a list of all substrings of a string. The returned list should be ordered by where in the string the substring begins. This means that all substrings that start at position 0 should come first, then all substrings that start at position 1, and so on. Since multiple substrings will occur at each position, the substrings at a given position should be returned in order from shortest to longest.
